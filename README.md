🔐 AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
📌 Project Overview

The AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a machine learning–based cybersecurity project designed to detect malicious activities in network traffic. The system analyzes traffic patterns and classifies them as normal or malicious using a supervised learning algorithm. An interactive web dashboard is provided to train the model, visualize performance, and test live network traffic.
